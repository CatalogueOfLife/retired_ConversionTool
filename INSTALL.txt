SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
====================

INSTALLATION
=============
1. Extract the application into the desired folder of the web server.

2. Configure the application

   The converter currently supports two conversions, Dynamic to Annual 
   Checklist and Annual Checklist to Base Scheme, but the former is experimental
   only and not supported.

   The Annual Checklist to Base Scheme is configured in config/AcToBs.ini

3. PHP and MySQL settings

   For optimal performance, at least 1024MB free memory should be available to
   PHP. If less memory is available and the scripts exits with a memory error, 
   the number of taxa processed per iteration should be reduced in AcToBs.php. 
   
   In line 93:
      for ($limit = 3000, $offset = 0; $offset < $total; $offset += $limit) {
   reduce the $limit to 2500 or less.
   
   To get an idea of the memory consumption of the script, line 96
      //echo showMemoryUse().' memory used<br>';
   can be uncommented.
   
   Furthermore, the following settings are strongly advised for MySQL. These
   should be set in my.cnf in the [mysqld] section:
      innodb_buffer_pool_size=256M
      tmp_table_size=128M
      max_heap_table_size=128M
       
   MySQL fulltext search is used to search distributions. The default minimal
   query string size is four characters.To set this to two characters, add 
   the following line to your my.cnf in the [mysqld] section:
      set-variable = ft_min_word_len=2
